Exploring the Impact of Corona Virus Through Data Analysisüåç 
The Corona Virus pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges to public health worldwide. As a data analyst, I had the opportunity to delve into the data to uncover insights and trends surrounding the spread of the virus. ü¶† 

Project Overview: In a bid to understand the magnitude of the pandemic, I embarked on a Corona Virus Analysis project, leveraging my SQL and data analysis skills. The goal was to derive meaningful insights from a dataset comprising crucial information such as confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries. 

Key Takeaways:
- Through meticulous analysis, identified geographic hotspots and trends in the spread of the virus. 

- By handling NULL values and calculating monthly averages, gained a deeper understanding of the evolving situation over time.

- Insights into minimum and maximum values per year shed light on the severity and impact of the pandemic in different periods.

- Also highlighted countries with the highest confirmed cases, lowest death rates, and top recoveries, providing valuable insights for public health strategies. 

The Journey Continues: As we navigate through these challenging times, data-driven insights play a crucial role in informing decisions and shaping interventions. I'm committed to continuing this journey of exploration and analysis to contribute towards mitigating the impact of the Corona Virus pandemic.
